## Overview of the Analysis

Are we really alone in this universe? Looking over all the data available on reported UFO sightings may help answer that question! The purpose of this analysis was to display a collection of UFO sighting data in a user-searchable table on an HTML built page. Users can search by date, location, and shape of the unidentified object to assist in drawing their own conclusions on this ages old question.

## Results

The results of this project? A tidy and searchable table of UFO sightings displayed on a simple but tasteful webpage. Black backgrounds with white text make the page more reader friendly, and a space themed header wraps in the theme nicely. As shown below, a user can enter one of four search parameters to narrow down the table of sightings that is displayed. The parameters? Date, city, state, country, and shape (of the object). The examples below show a search by state (CA), and a search by shape (cigar).

## Summary

A drawback of this webpage is that a person would need to have knowledge of UFO sightings to be able to search the data in a way that would be useful. A couple features that could be added would be a summary of some UFO hotspots as a starting point for checking out the data, as well as dropdown for the shape instead of user entered text. This would help people who may not be as familiar with UFO sightings to explore the data available.
